# Homelab Redux

## Introduction
**NOTE**: THIS PROJECT IS NOT IN A WORKABLE STATE YET

This project is dedicated to rebuilding my homelab with the goal of achieving
100% infrastructure-as-code. The aim is to create a fully automated and
reproducible environment that can be deployed from bare metal with minimal
manual intervention.

[Progress Log](./PROGRESS_LOG.md)

## Goals
- Transition from 50% to 100% infrastructure-as-code.
- Develop a homelab environment that can be easily spun up.
- Ensure failover between Kubernetes clusters.
- Create a fully functional Proxmox setup with a stacked Kubernetes configuration.

## Hardware Requirements
The homelab hardware consists of:
- Three low-power servers to minimize energy consumption.
- Network infrastructure including simple switches and VLANs.
- A separate, isolated network for the lab environment.

## Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of Proxmox and Kubernetes.
- Access to the necessary hardware as described above.
- A clean network environment to ensure isolation.
